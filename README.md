# EXP.NO.4-IMPLEMENTATION-OF-LINE-CODEING-TECHNIQUES

3.Implementation of Line Codeing Techniques 
  
## AIM:   

The objective of this experiment is to study the Line coding techniques using the trainer kit. 
 
## APPARATUS REQUIRED:

Trainer Kit, DSO(10MHz) , Patch Cords and Power Supply (0-30V)

## PROCEDURE:

1.Prepare Input Data Start with the binary bitstream to be transmitted.

2.Select Line Coding Technique Choose based on system requirements (e.g., NRZ, RZ, Manchester, AMI).

3.Define Signal Mapping

4.Assign specific voltage levels or transitions to bits (0s and 1s).Set Timing and Synchronization Rules Ensure each bit is sent in a fixed time slot;

5.Some codes embed clock information.Shape the Output Signal and Generate electrical/optical pulses according to the mapping.Transmit the Signal over Medium.

6.Send the shaped waveform through cable, fiber, or wireless link.Receive and Decode Signal Interpret received signals based on the line coding rules to recover original data.
